## Corpus Linguistics - Study 2 - Eduardo

- The `Mean Score` and `Standard Deviation` for the variable `adjque` from the original study are missing. The dummy values `MS = 8.96` and `SD = 4.97` were provisionally considered but they must be replaced by the correct values;
- During the verification a mistake has been identified in the spreadsheet `dimensao1_revCM.xlsx`. In cell `'z-escores'!CA3`, the following correction is necessary. This mistake is propagated throughout its column and across other columns:
    - From: `=normalizada!AA2-'z-escores'!BY3/'z-escores'!BZ3`
    - To: `=(normalizada!AA2-'z-escores'!BY3)/'z-escores'!BZ3`
